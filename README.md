This is the worlds simplest poker game!

## Brief
To build an application that shuffles a standard 52-card deck, and then deals a
fixed number of cards to each player. After each player has been dealt their cards, add up the
value of each hand and declare a winner (or winners, in the case of a draw).
Score each hand by summing the face value of each card (for Ace through ten), and the
following values for face cards: Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13.
The number of players should be configurable, as should the number of cards dealt. The game
should prevent an impossible combination of players and cards.
The basic solution doesn’t need a user interface beyond inputs (e.g. number of players) and
outputs (e.g. winning player).

## Requirements
It should meet all the functional requirements outlined in the test description, which you
will receive separately.
* There should be a README.
* The README should be written in Markdown.
* The README should include instructions for running the code locally.
* There should be >85% test coverage.
* Tests should include feature tests. Feature tests are high-level tests meant to exercise
slices of functionality through an application. They should drive the application only via
its external interface, e.g. its web pages.
* Code coverage should be measured programatically (e.g. with simplecov or similar).
* Code should be on GitHub.
* There should be some commit history showing your progress.
* There should be no secrets (e.g. API keys) committed.
* Classes and methods should have comment blocks explaining what they do. Any lines
of code that aren’t easily readable should also be commented.
* Variables, methods and classes should have readable & understandable names.
* There should be no leftover dependencies.
* Code should be deployed somewhere, publicly available, e.g. Heroku or Now.
* It should work across the latest versions of IE, Edge, Firefox, Safari and Chrome.
* It should work on your phone (let us know which platform you tested on).
* Pixie Labs use up-to-date MacBooks with Homebrew installed. Your code should run
on our machines. If you haven’t used a Mac to write your code, we will take that into
account if we have any issues.

## To run this code locally, in your CLI run:

```
npm run start:client
```
